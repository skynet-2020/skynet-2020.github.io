More About Me
==================

My motivation for science
------

I am motivated by x, y, and z. I believe science is meaningful because it informs our understanding of ethical issues that have implications for human well-being.

Background: <Br>
Scientists often refer to our current geological time as “The Anthropocene” because it highlights the massive impacts that human activities are having on our environment. A key concept of the Anthropocene is that human activities are putting pressure on ecosystems in multiple ways. Recent wildfires in Australia, California, and Colorado that had catastrophic effects on humans and nature are indicative of the trend of increasing wildfire frequency and size worldwide. Mass coral bleaching events in the [Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian] oceans [that destroy beautiful coral reefs] are strongly attributed to increasing sea temperatures due to climate change. The introduction of invasive species has altered the composition of animal and plant species in most ecosystems on earth. [drylands! Critical! Understudied!]. A key question that must be answered is: 

> What are the combined effects of multiple global environmental changes on dryland ecosystems? 

Multiple global environmental changes have already been shown to have interactive effects in dryland ecosystems worldwide. The establishment and spread of invasive grasses form a positive feedback loop with wildfire (grass-fire cycle) which is rapidly changing the composition of plant species in dryland ecosystems. However, there are multiple other global environmental changes that are relevant to drylands. 

Various human-related drivers of change cause rapid shifts in small-mammal populations, which can significantly alter trophic interactions that shape plant community composition. [Expand on this!].

In addition, climate change is causing rapid shifts in precipitation and temperature. [Expand on this!].

Research Question <Br>
As a result, it is critical to understand the extent to which shifts in rodent populations, repeated wildfire, and changes in climate affect plant community composition including the establishment of invasive annual grasses.
