        Niche Opportunities for Invasion

    <h2>
        Background
    </h2>

    <p> "The Anthropocene"--meaning 'age of humans'--is a term commonly used by scientists to describe our current geological era. This term is useful because it highlights the many ways that human activities are fundamentally altering earth's ecosystems. Catastrophic wildfires, increasing global temperature, and invasive species introductions are shifting plant and animal communities and, in turn, decreasing the benefits we recieve from nature. One question that is becoming increasingly relevant is: "What are the combined effects of multiple global environmental changes on earth's ecosystems?"

    <br />
    <br />

    Global changes have particularly profound effects on dryland ecosystems. The establishment and spread of invasive grasses form a positive feedack loop with wildfire (grass-fire cycle), which is shifting dryland plant communities from shrublands to degraded grasslands. Additionally, droughts and wildfires cause shifts in rodent populations which could have unexpected consequences for the grass-fire cycle. Although small, rodents play a large role in determining which plants establish after fire through consumption of seeds and seedlings of native and invasive plants. In fact, preventing rodents from entering experimental plots after fire can cause [orders of magnitude] greater establishement of invasive grasses (citation)! Lastly, climate change is causing spatial and temporal shifts in soil water availability, which affects habitat suitability for invasive grasses. We know that these changes independently affect plant community composition in drylands, yet we know little about their combined effects.</p>
    
    <h2>
        Research Question
    </h2>
    
    <p>  We set out to answer the following question: "What are the interactive effects of the exclusion of rodents, repeated fire, and shifts in soil water availability on plant community composition in dryland ecosystems? </p>  
    
    <h2>
        Methods
    </h2>
    
    <p> In our Great Basin desert experimental site, we tested the effects of all three global envrionmental changes on dryland ecosystems. We simulated shifts in rodent populations by excluding rodents from our experimental plots using wire-mesh fences. Next, the BLM performed inital and repeated controlled burns to simulate increased fire frequency. Last, we simulated projected changes in the Great Basin by chronically reduing soil water availabilty with a pulse of soil water in the fall.
        
    <h2>
        Results
    </h2>

    <p> The graphical abstract shows the two critical findings of this study: First, the exclusion of rodents, repeated fire, and shifts in the timing and amount of soil water availability had interactive effects that magnified the establishment of invasive grasses. Second, all three environmental changes reduced plant community diversity.  </p>

    <h2>
        Implications
    </h2>
    
    <p> As human activities continue to affect dryland ecosystems, the instances in which fall water and repeated fire occur during rodent population crashes will become increasingly common, resulting in more opportunities for invasive grasses to take over plant communities in dryland ecosystems. [why is that plant community bad?] Although this study focused on invasive grasses in dryland ecosystems, it provides an example where the interactive effects of global changes degraded an ecosystem more than the sum of their respective independent effects. This provides valuable insight into the ability of global changes to cause rapid and possibly unexpected shifts in the structure of ecosystems.
