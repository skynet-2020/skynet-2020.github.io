    <h2>
        Background
    </h2>
    
    </p> Scientists often refer to our current geological time as “The Anthropocene” because it highlights the massive impacts that human activities are having on our environment. A key concept of the Anthropocene is that human activities are putting pressure on ecosystems in multiple ways. Recent wildfires in Australia, California, and Colorado that had catastrophic effects on humans and nature are indicative of the trend of increasing wildfire frequency and size worldwide. Mass coral bleaching events in the [Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian] oceans [that destroy beautiful coral reefs] are strongly attributed to increasing sea temperatures due to climate change. The introduction of invasive species has altered the composition of animal and plant species in most ecosystems on earth. [drylands! Critical! Understudied!]. A key question that must be answered is: What are the combined effects of multiple global environmental changes on dryland ecosystems? </p>
