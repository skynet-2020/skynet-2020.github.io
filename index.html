                                    I am a second-year PhD student at Arizona State University in the Landscape Ecology and Sustainability Lab (LESL) working under advisor Jingle Wu (center).

                                    Broadly, the research objective for my disseration is to explore the interactions between landscape pattern, climate change, and ecosystem services. A recent study estimates that humans have caused a land use transformation (e.g., forest to farmland) on one third of the global land surface in the last six decades. Additionaly, the most recent IPCC report estimates that humans have emitted enough greenhouse gases to increase global mean surface temperature by ~1.0C compared to pre-industrial levels. Research shows that both environmental changes are rearranging earth's ecosystems, resulting in changes to the goods and services we receive from ecosystems (e.g., food, freshwater, cultural ties to nature). To preserve ecosystem services, we must not only understand the direct effects of climate change and landscape pattern on ecosystem services, but also the interactions between landscape pattern, climate change, and ecosystem services.

                                    I am taking a novel approach that draws upon systems science in order to elucidate the key feedback loops bewteen landscape pattern, climate change, and ecosystem services. Here is a working conceptual framework for the land-climate-ecosystems (LCE) nexus:

                                    Before my PhD adventure at ASU, I earned a MS degree from Brigham Young University working under advisor Rick Gill. The research objective of my MS thesis was to understand how multiple global changes interact to affect plant communities after disturbance.

                                    The image above shows the experiment site where I tested how reduced rodent population, repeated wildfire, and shifts in the timing and amount of precipitation affect plant community structure after disturbance. The plastic gutters across the rainout shelter simulated projected changes in climate by deflecting year-round precipitation to go along with fall water additions. The wire mesh fence in the background excludes rodents to simulate naturally occuring changes in rodent populations. The stark contrast in vegetation on the inside vs. outside of our experimental plot are indicitave of inital and repeated burn treatments designed to simulate the increasing frequency and size of wildfire worldwide. This graphical abstract displays the key findings that are currently under review in the Journal Oecologia.

                                    My graduate research is meaningful to me because I believe it has immense potential to benefit society. Only by understanding and forecasting the effects of climate change can we limit human displacement by rising sea levels, reduce catastrophic wildfire, and generally protect the ecosystems we rely on. In this way, scientific investigation is critical to ensure sustainable futures for upcoming generations.

                                    Not only am I motivated to conduct research, but also to communicate important findings to society. In our current divided political climate, this is a challenging task. As I develop my dissertation project, here are some ideas I want to implement to make my research impactful.

                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                    <strong>Putting science in terms of people's value systems.</strong> Having grown up in the politically and religiously conservative town of Eagle, Idaho, I learned quickly that citing the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report was not an effective way of moving the needle. Instead, putting climate change in terms of environmental stewardship and accountability can be effective, especially for members of my faith. 
                                    
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                    <strong> Inter and transdisciplinary scientific research. </strong> More and more, scientists are realizing that incorporating multiple disciplines and non-scientist stakeholders into their research can increase the impact of their findings. Although I am at the beginning stage of my project, I am thinking of ways to include stakeholders from the sun corridor such as local or state government, institutions, indigenous peoples, and others into my dissertation research plans.

                                    Those who know me will tell you I am always progressing towards non-academic goals. Since we moved to Ariona, my wife Desiree and I made a goal to find all thirteen rattlesnake species in the state of Arizona. So far, we are up to seven! Two of our favorites are the rock rattlesnake (top right) and the black rattlesnake (bottom right). This has led to adventures across the state at the Mogollon Rim, sky islands, Supersition Mountains (top left), and Sonoran Desert National Monument (bottom left). We make sure to respect the rattlesnakes' space and only disturb them enough to try for a photo.
